# JSON Data Exercises

The file dsi_json_exercise_answers contains the solutions to the JSON Based Exercises from Unit 5.2 of the Sprinboard Data Science Career Track.

dsi_json_exercise_answers utilizes the file world_bank_projects.json, found in this folder. The world_bank_projects is a dataset of projects funded by the World Bank. The dataset can also be found at http://jsonstudio.com/resources/.

The questions answered in dsi_json_exercise_answers are:

1) What are the top 10 countries by number of projects funded by the World Bank?
2) What are the top 10 major project themes?
3) The 'mjtheme_namecode' column consists of lists of dictionaries that contain the code and name for each project theme. However, some of the names are missing. Create a DataFrame with these names filled.

Concepts used in these solutions are: importing json files as DataFrames, value_counts(), defaultdicts and OrderedDicts, transforming DataFrame columns
